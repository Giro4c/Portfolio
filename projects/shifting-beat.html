            <p>
                Shifting Beat is a Unity project made during the WonderJam A24, a game jam organized by the student association
                of UQAC that lasts 48 hours. The main theme for this edition was “Dimension” with 3 sub-themes for each team.
                Mine, composed of only three programmers with no artists, had: “A point for me” (Arcane), “Restart, Again”
                (Rogue-lite), and “Up the volume” (Music, Rhythm).
                <br>
                This project was a real challenge for me as my first game jam participation and my shortest project (2 days).

                <p>
                    Shifting Beat is a 3D beat ‘em up game with a third person isometric view in which the player must face
                    waves of enemies originating from multiple dimensions. Their objective is to survive and defeat as many
                    opponents as they can. The player can also travel between three dimensions (Dungeon, Toon Land, Cyberspace)
                    which each follow a specific theme with its own enemies, background music and layout.

                Attacking an entity gives points but the increment is higher if the action is done in rhythm with the
                background music’s beat. Doing so affects a combo which also affects the score increase.
                <br>
                Since the game includes a shop where players can buy upgrades to increase their stats, score or money
                earned, a monetary system is included with defeating enemies as the way to gain currency.

                        In this project, I was in charge of coding all subsystems related to the jam’s sub-themes my team
                        was given while my teammates did the character, the enemies (AI), the fighting system, dimension
                        environments, etc… I therefore had to do the Score, Shop & Upgrades, Save, and Rhythm subsystems.
                        <br>
                        The score subsystem as well as the shop and upgrades were quickly done and tested along with the
                        saving of the player’s high score and current money. Once those were done I created a main menu
                        which contained the shop and showed whether the player already has an upgrade or not.

                        The real difficulty in this project was the rhythm system for I had to find a way to synchronize
                        the environment with the audios as they are played asynchronously and can cause delayed feedback
                        or cause a beat skip because of the possible tick time difference. The other issue was to link
                        an action to the music’s beat and defining a trigger margin so that players don’t have to perform
                        an attack with a frame perfect timing which would be basically unplayable.
                    </p>

                <div class="media" style="align-self: center;">

                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="">
                <p>
                    To solve the first problem, I used an online video tutorial on how to sync an element from the
                    decor with an audio thanks to its BPM and its current time.
                    <br>
                    For the second, I made an In Rhythm Manager reliant on beat events “catching”, those events being
                    fired by the associated Beat Manager of each music audio source, and timers. This rhythm manager
                    treats all action triggered cases: after or before the current beat (within the error margin),
                    after an “unlinked” action still waiting for an associated beat. With this system, I was able to
                    easily control and adjust the timing difficulty, manage a streak combo all the while effectively
                    linking triggered actions to beats.
