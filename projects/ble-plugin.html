            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>
                During my internship at the CRVM, I was entrusted the task of making a Bluetooth Low-Energy Java plugin
                to connect to bluetooth captors and fitness machines whose data could be used to simulate a biking session
                for a coming project of the laboratory. I spent around two months working on this plugin and its use in Unity
                (parsing received binary data into readable and understandable data, sending data to the device, etc…)
                along with other projects. To help me in this endeavor, my supervisor gave me the code of the old plugin
                and its implementation in Unity that I would have to replace and upgrade as it no longer worked and was deprecated.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This project includes two realisations : a plugin and its implementation in a Unity package. Both are
                centered around Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE).
            </p>
            <p>
                The plugin allows users to search for nearby BLE devices and retrieve their MAC address. They can use
                this address to then connect or disconnect from one of those devices. For now, the plugin makes a connection
                for one GATT service per device though it supports multiple characteristics which can be read, written or
                subscribed to automatically depending on their properties (read, write, notify). The plugin supports
                Android API 32 and 33+.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Unity package serves to communicate with BLE devices using its dedicated plugin. All GATT characteristics
                properties and operations are supported, those being read, write and notify (subscription). This package
                includes readable data structures, parsers and procedure managers for each supported characteristic.

                        As the main needs for this project evolved, the plugin and package went through more than one version.
                        <br>
                        At first, the plugin only supported operations on only one characteristic per device then as I
                        started to read, write or subscribe to more data I had to refactor my code to support multiple
                        characteristics within the same GATT service. Later on, I discovered two important bugs that I had to fix.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="column grid-gallery">
                    <p>
                        The first was a compatibility problem between Android 32 and 33 where the latter replaced some
                        callbacks, including for characteristics red and notify, deprecating those from the former which
                        would never be called. It took me quite a while to actually find the cause of this issue, since I
                        couldn't find anything on forums, until I stumbled on a little deprecated mention in the official
                        documentation for Android API 33. In the end, I managed to fix this by adding duplicates of my
                        Android 33 compliant callbacks but with the signature from version 32.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="column grid-gallery">
                    <p>
                        The second bug I had to fix was related to GATT operations on BLE devices with a singular connection.
                        Indeed, a GATT client can only have one ongoing async operation at once which means that calling
                        for a read or write for example while there is still an operation in progress will lead to an automatic
                        drop of those requests since by default GATT doesn't have a request queue.
                        <br>
                        So I made my own using the observer design pattern and “notifications” fired after any supported GATT ends (its callback
                        has been called). However, I also had to implement the observer pattern with interfaces since the
                        default implementation in Java uses classes which restrict inheritance where I wanted to keep the
                        freedom of class parentage for code reusability purposes.

                        When I first made the implementation package which would subscribe to the Cycling Speed and Cadence
                        (CSC) Measurement characteristic and translate the collected data from a bit array to a data structure
                        with understandable values and attributes such as speed and cadence for example. I did not however
                        concern myself with code optimization to add new features (characteristics and services in this
                        case) more easily for the first version as the main focus was to test the plugin and find how to
                        do the parsing.

                    <p>
                        The first issue I was faced with was handling bluetooth permissions to be able to connect to BLE
                        devices so that the app would try to search or connect to devices only after the user gives the
                        necessary permissions and not before otherwise connections would never succeed at launch and there
                        would be no way no know accurately when to try again without using timers which would be inefficient anyway.
                        <br>
                        After looking into the official documentation regarding permission handling I found that I could
                        use callbacks I would link to the handler so that I can know when the user grants all permissions.
                        However, since the permission handler calls those callbacks for each granted or refused permission,
                        I also added a counter to ensure that the event announcing that the plugin is ready to be used would
                        be fired after all permissions were given and not after the first one granted.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="column grid-gallery">
                    <p>
                        Another issue I had to deal with was a global one where documentation concerning the GATT characteristics
                        was severely lacking in explanation of the data (especially the CSC Measurement one).
                        <br>
                        Indeed, in some cases, the documentation describes what is contained in the data package but never
                        where those attributes (which bits, length, unit, etc…) are in said package which is very frustrating
                        at times. Thankfully, with some research I found some posts on forums with the information I was looking for.
                        <br>
                        I also went through the same problem with sending data packages for characteristic writing although
                        the process was easier since I had time to get used to the vague explanations and bits conversion
                        by the time I started the support of writable characteristics.

                <div class="column grid-gallery">
                    <p>
                        Last obstacle I confronted was making my package accessible for adding new supported characteristics
                        and services. It took me some refactoring before I was satisfied with the final architecture.
                        <br>
                        For this last version, I isolated characteristics and their behaviors from their associated service
                        to turn them into independent objects. I could therefore give them common behavior without having
                        to copy-paste the same lines with minor changes by implementing interfaces which provided implementation
                        for each characteristic property and its related operations : Read, Write, and Notify. That way,
                        the only characteristics I had to give special behavior implementation were the writable ones.
                        <br>
                        Each characteristic has a parser and a data structure with the same common prefix for easy
                        understanding and debugging. Same goes for services which have sessions used to store data from
                        included characteristics and make calculations like the current speed based on the acceleration, etc…
