            <p>
                This online shooter project was due for a university course on multiplayer and online programming after
                we had learned and experimented with data replication, time sync and local session hosting. The goal of
                the project was to create a basic shooter game including online Steam session, lobby timers, selectable
                skins and server rewinds as its main features.
                <br>
                Each team was composed of 2 students and had 2 weeks to make the game.

                <p>
                    This third-person shooter is a multiplayer game in which 2 to 4 mercenaries players fight each other in
                    a military base. The game works with local and Steam online sessions.
                    <br>
                    Once a player joins a session, they are placed in one of the 2 possible teams which will define their
                    spawn point and appear in a lobby where they can select a skin and wait for the lobby to be full. In case
                    the lobby still hasn’t reached the necessary player number to start, the host can launch the timer themselves
                    to start the game.

                Within the game, each player needs to have a weapon equipped to be able to attack. Those pick-up-able weapons
                are placed near every spawn point. The game also includes visible kill counters for each player as well
                as a global kill history where everyone can see the latest kills.

                        In this project, I did most features related to shooting minus the equipping of a weapon.
                        Those were: shooting a player with the related server rewind for validation, a health and death
                        system, the kill counts and the kill history. I also made the skin system, the implementation of
                        the Online Subsystem for hosting and joining Steam sessions and was the main game debugger and bug
                        fixer when the game wouldn't work.
                        <br>
                        Among those features that I developed, the most difficult or interesting for me were the server
                        rewind, the kill history and testing the online system with Steam.

                    The server rewind was not a very hard feature to implement, my professor having explained how to
                    code it in class. Actually, most of the difficulties lay in using this feature for shooting:
                    when to use it and on whom ? Indeed, triggering a server rewind when a player shoots in any
                    direction even when it doesn't hit any player is unoptimized, more so since the server rewind would
                    need to be done for each existing player since no target would be specified. That’s why I first
                    had the client execute the action and only when this action resulted in hitting a rewindable
                    element would the real shoot action be executed on the server after a rewind.

                        The most interesting feature I had to develop for this project was the kill history because it
                        allowed me to practice struct replication and learn dynamic array replication which uses the push
                        system with the concept of “dirty” variables. The process of both writing the code and actually
                        understanding what exactly I was doing was an arduous process, but I managed and now can reproduce
                        this feature without any difficulties.

                    At some point in the programming of this functionality, I wanted to fire a delegate which would
                    allow me to update each player’s Hud after each new kill. I was a bit unsure how to have the
                    replicated data be retrieved by the actor (game state in this case) which has the replicated array
                    since a replicated array item has access to its owning array but said array has no way of sending
                    this data to its own. To fix that, I added a delegate inside the array struct which is fired by
                    each added item that has been replicated using the reference to their owning array struct.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        I never had any huge difficulties during this project except for one specific aspect not even
                        coding related: testing the Steam online subsystem features. The reason is in fact that to test
                        Steam online sessions, one must not have just two Steam accounts but also 2 separate computers
                        otherwise the created sessions never appear and can never be joined if two game instances are
                        used on the same computer. Since I did not possess a second computer, I had to rely on my partner
                        for session hosting which greatly restricted when to test the feature and what can be tested.
